# 🌱 Smart Agriculture Monitoring System (PFE)

This is my Final Year Project (PFE) at Abdelmalek Essaadi University, Polydisciplinary Faculty of Larache.

## 📌 Project Overview
We designed and implemented an **IoT-based smart agriculture system** that monitors and automates farming activities using:
- **Arduino Uno & ESP8266 NodeMCU** for sensors and automation
- **ESP32-CAM + Edge Impulse** for plant disease detection (AI at the edge)
- **Node-RED Dashboard** for real-time monitoring and control

## ⚡ Features
- Soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and water level monitoring  
- Automated irrigation and ventilation  
- Remote control via Node-RED web dashboard  
- AI-based plant disease detection with ESP32-CAM  

## 🛠️ Technologies
- Arduino, ESP8266, ESP32-CAM
- Node-RED, MQTT
- Edge Impulse (AI)
- Sensors: DHT22, Soil Moisture, Water Level, etc.
